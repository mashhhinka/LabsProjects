Mad Libs Story Generator

This Python program creates funny and creative stories based on user input, similar to the classic Mad Libs word game. When the program runs, the user selects one of three story templates: Hospital, Camping, or Enchanted Letter. After choosing a template, the user is prompted to enter different words such as nouns, adjectives, verbs, and numbers. The program then inserts those words into the chosen story and displays the completed story on the screen.

To run the program, save the code to a file named madlibs.py and execute it in a Python environment or terminal using the command python madlibs.py. Follow the prompts to enter your words and view your generated story. For example, if the user selects template 2 (Camping) and enters words like “Alice” and “flashlight,” the output will be a short, personalized story about a camping trip.

This project includes three unique story templates, accepts interactive user input, and produces a different story each time it runs.
